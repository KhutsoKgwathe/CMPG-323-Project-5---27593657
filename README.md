# Project Overview
EcoPower Logistic's comprehensive logistics solutins tackle the complexities of acquiring, storing and transporting resources and goods globally. 
The data collected and stored from the logistics management system can be shared and used in different ways to create insight for  business stakeholders.
Power BI is is one of the ways in which report visuals can be created to show insight and meaning to data.

Project 5 includes creating an interactive report on the data collected from the Logistics Management system. 
Using Microsoft Power BI we are able to create insights & analytical metrics that show the interactions & relationship of the data collected, creating meaning for information that would otherwise be seen as random related datasets.

The report contains 5 pages that show insight on data collected for Customers, Orders, Order Details, Products and High-level metrics which show business stakeholders a visual of important business data.
